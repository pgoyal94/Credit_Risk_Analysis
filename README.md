# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Help Jill use machine learning to predict credit risk for loan applicants.

## Overview of the analysis: 
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. We will help Jill employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. We will use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we will oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, we will use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, we will compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Finally, we will evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results: 
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary: 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
